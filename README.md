# AlcoholStatusPredictor

THIS IS MY FINAL PROJECT FOR STATS 101C - INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICAL MODELS AND DATA MINING - AT UCLA.
THE DATA WAS RETRIEVED FROM THE NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE IN SOUTH KOREA AND WAS PROCESSED USING R PACKAGES. USING VARIOUS MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS, I DEVELOPED A PREDICTIVE MODEL TO DETERMINE THE ALCOHOLIC STATUS OF AN INDIVIDUAL. MY RANDOM FOREST MODEL ACHIEVED AN ACCURACY OF 73%.
