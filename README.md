#Alcoholic Status Classification Model

This is my final project for Stats 101C - Introduction to Statistical Models and Data Mining - at UCLA. The data was retrieved from the National Health Insurace Service in South Korea, and was processed and cleaned using the R package, mice. Using various machine learning algorithms, I developed a predictive model to determine the alcoholic status of an individual. Results showed that the random forest model achieved an accuracy of 73%.
